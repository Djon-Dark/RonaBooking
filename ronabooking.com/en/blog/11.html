    <h1>Siguran boravak u Hrvatskoj</h1>

    <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-calendar"></span> Mar 30, 2021, 1:58:12 PM</p>

            <p><img src="https://static.selfin.my-rent.net/cache/posts/origin_11.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive" /></p>
    
    <p>Hrvatska brine o sigurnosti svojih građana ali i stranih gostiju, turista. U Hrvatskoj se poštuju sve preporučene mjere koje je prepisao Nacionalni stožer, fizička udaljenost te osobna higijena. Cijepljenje građana je od velike važnosti te je jako bitno da svi budemo procijepljeni kako bismo zaustavili širenje virusa Covid19. Pri dolasku u apartmane gosti nemaju nikakvog kontakta s recepcijom. Opremljeni smo vrhunskim online sustavom prijave/odjave gostiju kao i beskontaktnim naplaćivanjem računa. Vaša sigurnost i zdravlje nam je jako bitno te Vam upravo zbog toga nudimo temeljito čiste i pravilno dezinficirane apartmane. Pri čišćenju koristimo vrhunske, specijalizirane proizvode koji također nisu štetni za ljudsko, životinjsko zdravlje te ne štete okolišu.</p>

<p>Hrvatska je zemlje mediteranske blage klime, lijepo vrijeme i sunčani dani počinju od ranog proljeća. Otvoreni restorani i kafići imaju velike prostrane terase na kojima možete bezbrižno jesti ili popiti kavu.</p>

<p>Najidealniji oblik sigurnosti smatra se fizička distanca, avanturistima, ljubiteljima prirode i fizičkih aktivnosti na otvorenom predlažemo odlazak u prirodu. Siguran boravak zajamčen Vam je na našim planinama, Učka, Ćićarija, Velebit.</p>

<p>Sjeverni Velebit je najmlađi Hrvatski nacionalni park proglašen 1999. godine. Na Sjevernom Velebitu nalazi se planinarski dom Zavižan koji je ujedno i najviša mjerna meteorološka postaja u Hrvatskoj.</p>

<p>Učka i Ćićarija dva su planinska masiva koji stvaraju jedinstven planinski lanac na sjeveru Istre. Najviši vrh Učke jeste Vojak (1401 m), a najviši vrh Ćićarije jeste Veliki Planik (1272 m). Kroz cijelo područje isprepliću se markacijama označeni planinarski putevim s kojih se pruža neprocjenjiv, i predivan pogled.</p>

<p>Odlučite li se posjetiti otok Lošinj, predlažemo Vam da iskoristite dan u prirodi i posjetite Osorčicu s kojega se pruža predivan pogled na lošinjski arhipelag, Velebit, obale Istre te otoke Rab i Pag.</p>

They must also adjust their behaviour as not to disturb the other guests, neighbours and host. In the event of the guest not adjusting their behaviour with the House rules even after being warned, they lose their right to the booked accommodation and must leave immediately without compensation. Any damages and deficiencies caused or discovered by the guests must immediately be reported to the person in charge of the keys or RONA employee. This way damages and deficiencies will immediately be removed without lessening the quality of stay. The guest is responsible for any damages or deficiencies they've cause if they cannot prove that they're not responsible. The same applies if the accommodation unit, due to damages, dirt or missing equipment cannot be submitted to the next guest for them to use. Rona will charge the guest on the spot for any damages or deficiencies.                </div>

                <div class="modal-text pb-2">It is the guest's obligation to consciously handle the unit and its inventory. On the day of departure the accommodation unit must be in the same condition as it was when the guest arrived. In the event of the accommodation's condition differing from its condition when booked, the guest must immediately notify the person in charge of the keys. If visible irregularities are not reported immediately after arriving, it will be assumed that the unit was handed over in proper condition. If any irregularities occur during the guest's stay, it is their obligation to act in the same way. In the event of the owner or person in charge of the keys being unable to rectify the irregularity within a reasonable period, it is the guest's duty to inform Rona call centre.                </div>
                <div class="modal-text pb-2">If the guest voluntarily leaves the facility or finds other accommodation without giving RONA time to resolve the issue causing the guest's dissatisfaction, the guest loses their right to receive compensation regardless of whether their reasons for departure were justified or not. Compensation requests must be delivered to RONA in written form within two weeks after using the accommodation unit with proof included (pictures, witness statements etc.). Complaints made after the two-week deadline will not be taken into consideration. We emphasize that it is in the guest's interest to act in good faith and show willingness to resolve their complaint during their stay and to give their written complaint to Rona on the spot, and request written confirmation that the complaint has been received. If the guest does not meet these requirements, they lose their right to receive compensation. RONA is obligated to deliver a written decision regarding the complaint within 21 days of receiving the complaint in the same form (e-mail, ordinary mail, or personal delivery which will be replied by registered post with a return receipt). If it is necessary in order to gather information and verify the claims in the complaint, RONA may postpone the decision deadline for another 14 days, of which it is obligated to inform the guest making the complaint in written form. RONA will resolve only those complaints for which the guest provides evidence that they gave their written complaint to the service provider on the spot and that the cause could not be eliminated on the spot. Until RONA reaches a decision, the guest must refrain from mediation by any other person, judicial institution or giving information to the media.                </div>

                <div class="modal-text pb-2">RONA agrees to give the guest for the booked period a clean and tidy accommodation unit equipped according to its description. If the unit does not match the description on the reservation, RONA will do everything to ensure the removal of any deficiencies, ie to ensure replacement accommodation of equal value. In the event of this being impossible, not being achieved in a reasonable period, or if the guest refuses the suggested replacement accommodation, RONA will reimburse the guest any form of value reduction, as long as it has been undeniably established that RONA is responsible for it. If the guest experiences loss or damage due to RONA's negligence, resulting in violation of the contract, RONA accepts full responsibility for the caused damage. RONA's legal responsibility is limited to the amount of the accommodation's price (during which everyone's claims are paid together) and does not include personal damages such as material and financial losses. RONA wil not be responsible in the event of the losses or damages being attributed to the following causes:                </div>
                <div class="modal-text pb-2">- Actions or omissions made by the guest or their companions;                </div>

They must also adjust their behaviour as not to disturb the other guests, neighbours and host. In the event of the guest not adjusting their behaviour with the House rules even after being warned, they lose their right to the booked accommodation and must leave immediately without compensation. Any damages and deficiencies caused or discovered by the guests must immediately be reported to the person in charge of the keys or RONA employee. This way damages and deficiencies will immediately be removed without lessening the quality of stay. The guest is responsible for any damages or deficiencies they've cause if they cannot prove that they're not responsible. The same applies if the accommodation unit, due to damages, dirt or missing equipment cannot be submitted to the next guest for them to use.

                <div class="modal-text pb-2">It is the guest's obligation to consciously handle the unit and its inventory. On the day of departure the accommodation unit must be in the same condition as it was when the guest arrived. In the event of the accommodation's condition differing from its condition when booked, the guest must immediately notify the person in charge of the keys. If visible irregularities are not reported immediately after arriving, it will be assumed that the unit was handed over in proper condition. If any irregularities occur during the guest's stay, it is their obligation to act in the same way. In the event of the owner or person in charge of the keys being unable to rectify the irregularity within a reasonable period, it is the guest's duty to inform Rona call centre.                </div>
                <div class="modal-text pb-2">If the guest voluntarily leaves the facility or finds other accommodation without giving RONA time to resolve the issue causing the guest's dissatisfaction, the guest loses their right to receive compensation regardless of whether their reasons for departure were justified or not. Compensation requests must be delivered to RONA in written form within two weeks after using the accommodation unit with proof included (pictures, witness statements etc.). Complaints made after the two-week deadline will not be taken into consideration. We emphasize that it is in the guest's interest to act in good faith and show willingness to resolve their complaint during their stay and to give their written complaint to Rona on the spot, and request written confirmation that the complaint has been received. If the guest does not meet these requirements, they lose their right to receive compensation. RONA is obligated to deliver a written decision regarding the complaint within 21 days of receiving the complaint in the same form (e-mail, ordinary mail, or personal delivery which will be replied by registered post with a return receipt). If it is necessary in order to gather information and verify the claims in the complaint, RONA may postpone the decision deadline for another 14 days, of which it is obligated to inform the guest making the complaint in written form. RONA will resolve only those complaints for which the guest provides evidence that they gave their written complaint to the service provider on the spot and that the cause could not be eliminated on the spot. Until RONA reaches a decision, the guest must refrain from mediation by any other person, judicial institution or giving information to the media.                </div>

If the unit does not match the description on the reservation, RONA will do everything to ensure the removal of any deficiencies, ie to ensure replacement accommodation of equal value. In the event of this being impossible, not being achieved in a reasonable period, or if the guest refuses the suggested replacement accommodation, RONA will reimburse the guest any form of value reduction, as long as it has been undeniably established that RONA is responsible for it. If the guest experiences loss or damage due to RONA's negligence, resulting in violation of the contract, RONA accepts full responsibility for the caused damage. RONA's legal responsibility is limited to the amount of the accommodation's price (during which everyone's claims are paid together) and does not include personal damages such as material and financial losses. RONA wil not be responsible in the event of the losses or damages being attributed to the following causes:                </div>

However, despite this we are unable to exclude the possibility of price and service change. In the event of such changes, the guest will be notified when booking or, at the latest, upon receiving booking confirmation. The items written on the booking confirmation are final. It is unlikely that any changes will occur after the booking confirmation, but we cannot entirely exclude not even this possibility. In the event of any significant changes occurring, the guest has the right to cancel the reservation with no charges being made within 7 days of being notified. Payments already made will be refunded. RONA has right to change prices up to 22 days before arrival, due to increasing or introduction of fees or taxes on certain services, or due to significant changes in the rate of exchange after concluding the reservation. The guest also has right to cancel reservation in the event of a price increase of more than 10 %, under the same conditions listed in the previous article.                </div>

The same applies to children, regardless of their age, with the exception of facilities allowing another child under the age of four free of charge. The guest is asked to mention this fact while booking. It is also forbidden to place tents or caravans on the land belonging to accommodation unit. In the event of exceeding the maximum number of people, or placing a tent or caravan on the accommodation's land, the owner may charge a fee per extra person, or remove the extra people from the estate, or demand the removal of the tent or caravan. If the guest ignores the request, everyone will be removed from the estate and no refund will be made.                </div>

                <div class="modal-text pb-2">Despite thorough cleaning and maintenance of our facilities, occasionally a bug or mouse may be found who got there from their natural habitat where the house is located. RONA cannot be held responsible for this. Although pets aren't allowed in all facilities, this does not mean that there have never been any pets in the booked accommodation. RONA does not take any responsibility for the guest's allergic reactions in certain facilities.                </div>

Despite this, we cannot guarantee that there will be no noise during the guest's stay, because we cannot affect or control things such as traffic noise, noises from nearby construction sites etc. Neither the owner nor RONA can be held responsible for noises coming from the facility's surroundings.                </div>

                    7. Ensuring replacement accommodation and reservation cancellation by RONA                </div>

                <div class="modal-text pb-2">In exceptional cases due to unpredictable or unavoidable circumstances, RONA may give the guest appropriate replacement accommodation of equal value and quality. RONA is authorized to cancel the reservation before or during the period of the guest using the accommodation, if unpredictable or unavoidable circumstances occur preventing the accommodation's usage, endangering the guest or accommodation, or lessening the service's quality to the point of it being impossible to provide the contracted service. In this case the guest will be refunded for payments already made, less end by the cost of already-used services. In any case RONA is not required to pay the guest compensation.                </div>
                <div class="modal-label">
                    8. Other obligations of the guest                </div>
                <div class="modal-text pb-2">During their stay, it is the guest's duty to use the accommodation owner's property and equipment with appropriate care. They must also adjust their behaviour as not to disturb the other guests, neighbours and host. In the event of the guest not adjusting their behaviour with the House rules even after being warned, they lose their right to the booked accommodation and must leave immediately without compensation. Any damages and deficiencies caused or discovered by the guests must immediately be reported to the person in charge of the keys or RONA employee. This way damages and deficiencies will immediately be removed without lessening the quality of stay. The guest is responsible for any damages or deficiencies they've cause if they cannot prove that they're not responsible. The same applies if the accommodation unit, due to damages, dirt or missing equipment cannot be submitted to the next guest for them to use. Rona will charge the guest on the spot for any damages or deficiencies.                </div>
                <div class="modal-label">
                    9. Complaints and compensation claims                </div>

                <div class="modal-text pb-2">It is the guest's obligation to consciously handle the unit and its inventory. On the day of departure the accommodation unit must be in the same condition as it was when the guest arrived. In the event of the accommodation's condition differing from its condition when booked, the guest must immediately notify the person in charge of the keys. If visible irregularities are not reported immediately after arriving, it will be assumed that the unit was handed over in proper condition. If any irregularities occur during the guest's stay, it is their obligation to act in the same way. In the event of the owner or person in charge of the keys being unable to rectify the irregularity within a reasonable period, it is the guest's duty to inform Rona call centre.                </div>
                <div class="modal-text pb-2">If the guest voluntarily leaves the facility or finds other accommodation without giving RONA time to resolve the issue causing the guest's dissatisfaction, the guest loses their right to receive compensation regardless of whether their reasons for departure were justified or not. Compensation requests must be delivered to RONA in written form within two weeks after using the accommodation unit with proof included (pictures, witness statements etc.). Complaints made after the two-week deadline will not be taken into consideration. We emphasize that it is in the guest's interest to act in good faith and show willingness to resolve their complaint during their stay and to give their written complaint to Rona on the spot, and request written confirmation that the complaint has been received. If the guest does not meet these requirements, they lose their right to receive compensation. RONA is obligated to deliver a written decision regarding the complaint within 21 days of receiving the complaint in the same form (e-mail, ordinary mail, or personal delivery which will be replied by registered post with a return receipt). If it is necessary in order to gather information and verify the claims in the complaint, RONA may postpone the decision deadline for another 14 days, of which it is obligated to inform the guest making the complaint in written form. RONA will resolve only those complaints for which the guest provides evidence that they gave their written complaint to the service provider on the spot and that the cause could not be eliminated on the spot. Until RONA reaches a decision, the guest must refrain from mediation by any other person, judicial institution or giving information to the media.                </div>

                    10. RONA's obligations                </div>
                <div class="modal-text pb-2">RONA agrees to give the guest for the booked period a clean and tidy accommodation unit equipped according to its description. If the unit does not match the description on the reservation, RONA will do everything to ensure the removal of any deficiencies, ie to ensure replacement accommodation of equal value. In the event of this being impossible, not being achieved in a reasonable period, or if the guest refuses the suggested replacement accommodation, RONA will reimburse the guest any form of value reduction, as long as it has been undeniably established that RONA is responsible for it. If the guest experiences loss or damage due to RONA's negligence, resulting in violation of the contract, RONA accepts full responsibility for the caused damage. RONA's legal responsibility is limited to the amount of the accommodation's price (during which everyone's claims are paid together) and does not include personal damages such as material and financial losses. RONA wil not be responsible in the event of the losses or damages being attributed to the following causes:                </div>
                <div class="modal-text pb-2">- Actions or omissions made by the guest or their companions;                </div>
                <div class="modal-text pb-2">- Unpredictable or inevitable failures of third parties not included in providing the service listed in the booking;                </div>
                <div class="modal-text pb-2">- Force majeure or events which could not be foreseen or avoided by RONA, the travel agent or the person in charge of the keys;                </div>
                <div class="modal-text pb-2">- Using swimming pools, children's playgrounds, any sports' facilities (eg. a tennis court or football field, fitness centres etc.). Use of these facilities is exclusively at the guest's own risk;                </div>
                <div class="modal-text pb-2">- Damages and losses due to burglary.                </div>
                <div class="modal-text pb-2">The above listed causes equally apply outside the contractual obligations. RONA specifically rules out responsibility for the actions of the auxiliary staff.                </div>
